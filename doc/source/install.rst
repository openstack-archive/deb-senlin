============
Installation
============

There are in general two ways to install Senlin service: you can install it
via devstack, or you install it manually, following the steps outlined in this
document.


Install via Devstack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is the recommended way to install the Senlin service. Please refer to
following detailed instructions.

1. Download DevStack::

    $ git clone https://git.openstack.org/openstack-dev/devstack
    $ cd devstack

2. Add following repo as external repositories into your ``local.conf`` file::

    [[local|localrc]]
    #Enable senlin
    enable_plugin senlin https://git.openstack.org/openstack/senlin
    #Enable senlin-dashboard
    enable_plugin senlin-dashboard https://git.openstack.org/openstack/senlin-dashboard

3. Run ``./stack.sh``::

    $ ./stack.sh

Note that Senlin client is also installed when following the instructions.


Manual Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install Senlin Server
---------------------

1. Get Senlin source code from OpenStack git repository.

::

  $ cd /opt/stack
  $ git clone http://git.openstack.org/openstack/senlin.git

2. Install Senlin with required packages.

::

  $ cd /opt/stack/senlin
  $ sudo pip install -e .

3. Register Senlin clustering service with keystone.

   This can be done using the :command:`setup-service` script under the
   :file:`tools` folder.

::

  $ source ~/devstack/openrc admin
  $ cd /opt/stack/senlin/tools
  $ ./setup-service <HOST IP> <SERVICE_PASSWORD>

4. Generate configuration file for the Senlin service.

::

  $ cd /opt/stack/senlin
  $ tools/gen-config
  $ sudo mkdir /etc/senlin
  $ sudo cp etc/senlin/api-paste.ini /etc/senlin
  $ sudo cp etc/senlin/policy.json /etc/senlin
  $ sudo cp etc/senlin/senlin.conf.sample /etc/senlin/senlin.conf

Edit file :file:`/etc/senlin/senlin.conf` according to your system settings.
The most common options to be customized include:

::

  [database]
  connection = mysql://senlin:<MYSQL_SENLIN_PW>@127.0.0.1/senlin?charset=utf8

  [keystone_authtoken]
  auth_uri = http://<HOST>:5000/v3
  auth_version = 3
  cafile = /opt/stack/data/ca-bundle.pem
  identity_uri = http://<HOST>:35357
  admin_user = senlin
  admin_password = <SENLIN PASSWORD>
  admin_tenant_name = service

  [authentication]
  auth_url = http://<HOST>:5000/v3
  service_username = senlin
  service_password = <SENLIN PASSWORD>
  service_project_name = service

  [oslo_messaging_rabbit]
  rabbit_userid = <RABBIT USER ID>
  rabbit_hosts = <HOST>
  rabbit_password = <RABBIT PASSWORD>

  [oslo_messaging_notifications]
  driver = messaging

For more comprehensive helps on configuration options, please refer to
:doc:`Configuration Options <configuration>` documentation.


5. Create Senlin Database.

 Create Senlin database using the :command:`senlin-db-recreate` script under
 the :file:`tools` subdirectory. Before calling the script, you need edit it
 to customize the password you will use for the ``senlin`` user. You need to
 update this script with the <DB PASSWORD> entered in step4.

::

  $ cd /opt/stack/senlin/tools
  $ ./senlin-db-recreate

6. Start senlin engine and api service.

 You may need two consoles for the services i.e., one for each service.

::

  $ senlin-engine --config-file /etc/senlin/senlin.conf
  $ senlin-api --config-file /etc/senlin/senlin.conf

Install Senlin Client
---------------------

1. Get Senlin client code from OpenStack git repository.

::

  $ cd /opt/stack
  $ git clone http://git.openstack.org/openstack/python-senlinclient.git

2. Install senlin client.

::

  $ cd python-senlinclient
  $ sudo python setup.py install

Verify Your Installation
------------------------

To check whether Senlin server and Senlin client have been installed
successfully, run command ``openstack cluster build info`` in a console.
The installation is successful if the command output looks similar to the
following.

::

  $ openstack cluster build info
  +----------+---------------------+
  | Property | Value               |
  +----------+---------------------+
  | api      | {                   |

  |          | }                   |
  | engine   | {                   |
  |          |   "revision": "1.0" |
