================================
Building An Auto-Scaling Cluster
================================

The senlin service provides a rich set of facilities for building an
auto-scaling solution:

- *Operations*: The ``CLUSTER_SCALE_OUT``, ``CLUSTER_SCALE_IN`` operations are
  the simplest form of commands to scale a cluster. The ``CLUSTER_RESIZE``
  operation, on the other hand, provides more options for controlling the
  detailed cluster scaling behavior. These operations can be performed with
  and without policies attached to a cluster.

- *Policies*:
  The ``senlin.policy.scaling`` (:doc:`link <../policy_types/scaling>`) policy
  can be applied to fine tune the cluster scaling operations.
  The ``senlin.policy.deletion`` (:doc:`link <../policy_types/deletion>`)
  policy can be attached to a cluster to control how nodes are removed from a
  cluster.
  The ``senlin.policy.affinity`` (:doc:`link <../policy_types/affinity>`)
  policy can be used to control how node affinity or anti-affinity can be
  enforced.
  The ``senlin.policy.region_placement``
  (:doc:`link <../policy_types/region_placement>`) can be applied to scale a
  cluster across multiple regions.
  The ``senlin.policy.zone_placement``
  (:doc:`link <../policy_types/zone_placement>`) can be enforced to achieve
  a cross-availability-zone node distribution.

- *Receivers*: The receiver (:doc:`link <../receivers>`) concept provides a
  channel to which you can send signals or alarms from an external monitoring
  software or service so that scaling operations can be automated.

This section provides some guides on integrating senlin with other services
so that cluster scaling can be automated.
