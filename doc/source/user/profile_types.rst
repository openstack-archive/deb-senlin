Profile Types
=============

Concept
~~~~~~~

A :term:`Profile Type` can be treated as the meta-type of a :term:`Profile`
object. A registry of profile types is built in memory when Senlin engine
(:program:`senlin-engine`) is started. In future, Senlin will allow users to
provide additional profile type implementations as plug-ins to be loaded
dynamically.

A profile type implementation dictates which fields are required. When a
profile is created by referencing this profile type, the fields are assigned
with concrete values. For example, a profile type can be ``os.heat.stack``
that conceptually specifies the properties required:

::

  context: Map
  template: Map
  parameters: Map
  files: Map
  timeout: Integer
  disable_rollback: Boolean
  environment: Map

A profile of type ``os.heat.stack`` may look like:

::

  # a spec for os.heat.stack
  type: os.heat.stack
  version: 1.0
  properties:
    context:
      region_name: RegionOne
    template:
      heat_template_version: 2014-10-16
      parameters:
        length: Integer
      resources:
        rand:
          type: OS::Heat::RandomString
          properties:
            len: {get_param: length}
      outputs:
        rand_val:
          value: {get_attr: [rand, value]}
    parameters:
      length: 32
    files: {}
    timeout: 60
    disable_rollback: True
    environment: {}


Listing Profile Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Senlin server comes with some built-in profile types. You can check the list
of profile types using the following command::

  $ openstack cluster profile type list
  +--------------------+
  | name               |
  +--------------------+
  | os.heat.stack-1.0  |
  | os.nova.server-1.0 |
  +--------------------+

The output is a list of profile types supported by the Senlin server.


Showing Profile Details
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each :term:`Profile Type` has a schema for its *spec* (i.e. specification)
that describes the names and the types of properties that can be accepted. To
show the schema of a specific profile type along with other properties, you
can use the following command::

  $ openstack cluster profile type show os.heat.stack-1.0
  name: os.heat.stack
  schema:
    context:
      default: {}
      description: A dictionary for specifying the customized context for
        stack operations
      readonly: false
      required: false
      type: Map
    disable_rollback:
      default: true
      description: A boolean specifying whether a stack operation can be
        rolled back.
      readonly: false
      required: false
      type: Boolean
    <... omitted ...>
    timeout:
      description: A integer that specifies the number of minutes that a
        stack operation times out.
      readonly: false
      required: false
      type: Integer

Here, each property has the following attributes:

- ``default``: the default value for a property when not explicitly specified;
- ``description``: a textual description of the use of a property;
- ``readonly``: a boolean indicating whether a property is read only for
  reasons like being part of the outputs of an object;
- ``required``: whether the property must be specified. Such kind of a
  property usually doesn't have a ``default`` value.
- ``type``: one of ``String``, ``Integer``, ``Boolean``, ``Map`` or ``List``.

The default output from the :command:`openstack cluster profile type show`
command is in YAML format. You can choose to show the spec schema in JSON
format by specifying the :option:`-f json` option as exemplified below::

  $ openstack cluster profile type show -f json os.heat.stack-1.0
  {
    "name": "os.heat.stack",
    "schema": {
      "files": {
        "default": {},
        "readonly": false,
        "required": false,
        "type": "Map",
        "description": "Contents of files referenced by the template, if any."
      },
      <... omitted ...>
      "context": {
        "default": {},
        "readonly": false,
        "required": false,
        "type": "Map",
        "description": "A dictionary for specifying the customized context for stack operations"
      }
    },
  }
