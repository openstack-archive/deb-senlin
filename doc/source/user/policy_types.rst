Policy Types
============

Concept
~~~~~~~

A :term:`Policy Type` is an abstract specification of the rules to be checked
and/or enforced when certain :term:`Action` is performed on a cluster that
contains nodes of certain :term:`Profile Type`.

A registry of policy types is built in memory when the Senlin engine
(:program:`senlin-engine`) is started. In future, Senlin will allow users to
provide additional policy type implementations as plug-ins to be loaded
dynamically.

A policy type implementation dictates which fields are required, which fields
are optional and sometimes the constraints on field values. When a
:term:`policy` is created by referencing this policy type, the fields are
assigned with concrete values. For example, a policy type
``senlin.policy.deletion`` conceptually specifies the properties required::

  criteria: String # valid values - OLDEST_FIRST, YOUNGEST_FIRST, RANDOM
  destroy_after_deletion: Boolean
  grace_period: Integer
  reduce_desired_capacity: Boolean

The specification of a policy object of this policy type may look like
following::

  type: senlin.policy.deletion
  version: 1.0
  properties:
    criteria: OLDEST_FIRST
    destroy_after_deletion: True
    grace_period: 120
    reduce_desired_capacity: True


Listing Policy Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Senlin server comes with some built-in policy types. You can check the list
of policy types using the following command::

  $ openstack cluster policy type list
  +------------------------------------+
  | name                               |
  +------------------------------------+
  | senlin.policy.affinity-1.0         |
  | senlin.policy.deletion-1.0         |
  | senlin.policy.health-1.0           |
  | senlin.policy.loadbalance-1.0      |
  | senlin.policy.region_placement-1.0 |
  | senlin.policy.scaling-1.0          |
  | senlin.policy.zone_placement-1.0   |
  +------------------------------------+


The output is a list of policy types supported by the Senlin server.


Showing Policy Details
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each :term:`Policy Type` has a schema for its *spec* (i.e. specification)
that describes the names and types of the properties that can be accepted. To
show the schema of a specific policy type along with other properties, you can
use the following command::

  $ openstack cluster policy type show senlin.policy.deletion-1.0
  name: senlin.policy.deletion
  schema:
    criteria:
      constraints:
      - constraint:
        - OLDEST_FIRST
        - OLDEST_PROFILE_FRIST
        - YOUNGEST_FIRST
        - RANDOM
        type: AllowedValues
      default: RANDOM
      description: Criteria used in selecting candidates for deletion
      readonly: false
      required: false
      type: String
    destroy_after_deletion:
      default: true
      description: Whether a node should be completely destroyed after
        deletion. Default to True
      readonly: false
      required: false
      type: Boolean
    grace_period:
      default: 0
      description: Number of seconds before real deletion happens.
      readonly: false
      required: false
      type: Integer
    reduce_desired_capacity:
      default: false
      description: Whether the desired capacity of the cluster should be
        reduced along with the deletion. Default to False.
      readonly: false
      required: false
      type: Boolean

Here, each property has the following attributes:

- ``default``: the default value for a property when not explicitly specified;
- ``description``: a textual description of the use of a property;
- ``readonly``: a boolean indicating whether a property is read only;
- ``required``: whether the property must be specified. Such kind of a
  property usually doesn't have a ``default`` value.
- ``type``: one of ``String``, ``Integer``, ``Boolean``, ``Map`` or ``List``.

The default output from the :command:`policy-type-show` command is in YAML
format. You can choose to show the spec schema in JSON format by specifying
the :option:`-f json` option as shown below::

  $ openstack cluster policy type show -f json senlin.policy.deletion-1.0

For information on how to manage the relationship between a policy and a
cluster, please refer to :ref:`ref-bindings`.
